1. First when user hits root page '/'

2. then angular dev server response with all code 
and sends down all the modules it needs.

3. But all the comp are not needed initially

4. so, alternatively angular dev server sends only APP
MODULE and will see the landing page.

And if users clicks on some link, then web pg asks for 
that specific module and then server response with that
specific module.

Implementation:
1. select module to be not loaded up.
2. remove import statement for these modules.
3. in appRoutingModule, define route obj and define rule to decide 
when we want to load that module.
4.
